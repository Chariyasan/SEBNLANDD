# Introduction

### *Section 1 : Pain point*

Every morning when I go to University, I saw the truck sell ingredients and vegetables it calls PUM PUANG’s cars. Food vendors had to come out and wait for the car every morning to buy ingredients. You can also head out to the market in the morning to buy fresh ingredients every day to prepare for the crowded meals. It is a waste of time to shop. Some shops even leave a motorcycle to buy, which each time will pay at least 50 baht delivery fee, which is unable to know whether each time will receive the number of materials ordered or will the quality be fresh or not? , Some restaurants require at least four hours to prepare ingredients, and if the ingredients are late, it may take longer to prepare them on time, so Vegeat’s would like to solve these problems including the technology that both Convenience, speed, and quality ingredients.

### *Section 2 : Concept*

Vegeat is an intermediary for delivering the ingredients between restaurant and grocery stores, also known as business to business. The method of doing this is the vegetable shop will deliver the goods to us and Vegeat will be the stockiest because it is prepared. to deliver according to the customer’s order. To save time on the cooking of the restaurant. To order ingredients will use the application of Veget, the application can convert the food picture to letter to help the users to search the item, the application will use special technology. To be convenient and quick to order food in the morning. As for anything else, Vegeat has a daily update of raw material price changes and GPS to check if Vegeat's vehicle has been delivered to your customers. Vegeat also has a stack of ingredients shop information. To make statistics to assess the quality as well and fast delivery service.

### *Section 3 : Business Strategies*

For the business Strategies Vegeat's have six main majors: starting with "raw materials", Vegeat's chooses the ingredient it has to be fresh, clean, and non-toxic. However, Vegeat’s will update the store's price information for Vegeat’s customers to let their to explore the price and can select the store at the most affordable price, Next is the choice or contact of Vegeat’s via the online application platform, the customer can choose the channel to use the product and contact the company directly or contact the company's usage issue. Number fourth of Vegeat’s is that we will refund if the ingredients that the restaurant receives are not fresh or damaged, and the final main major is that Vegeat’s has the expert employees to check the ingredients that purchased by Vegeat’s every time, which guarantees that the restaurant customers will receive the best fresh and safe, non-toxic items. For the information of the shipment is detailed. The customer can view the service purchase history at any time and the customer can set the date and time to purchase from Sunday to Monday, mostly for 7 days.

### *Section 4 : Target Customer*

The Restaurant area Salaya district (in front of Mahidol University and nearby) or restaurants that need local rare ingredients, as well as restaurants that need ingredients that are converted safely and safely. In a convenient, fast time and immediately.

### *Section 5 : Distance Shipping*

Delivery is a daily-delivery and charges are collected by distance. However, if using the “Fast Delivery” service, an additional 10% charge will be charged, starting at 20 baht when using regular delivery and 50 baht or more when using Fast Delivery service.

### *Section 6 : Future Plan*

From The Vegeat’s may lead the dry food ingredients to sale and expand the service area to be more extensive and comprehensive, and develop logistics in terms of time and quality in order to become a major source of export of raw materials to both domestic and international.
